# Political Twitter Archive

Feel free to use the data. Let me know if you come up with anything cool.

Each folder contains four files:
  - A CSV file (open with Excel or Google Spreadsheets)
  - A user_ids.json file (contains all known tweet ids)
  - A user_long.zip file (very large json file with every tweet and all metadata)
  - A user_short.zip file (pretty large json file with every tweet and most relevant metadata)

The data was scraped using this method:
