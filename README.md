# Political Twitter Archive

Feel free to use the data. Let me know if you come up with anything cool.

Each folder contains four files:
1) A CSV file (open with Excel or Google Spreadsheets)
2) A user_ids.json file (contains all known tweet ids)
3) A user_long.zip file (very large json file with every tweet and all metadata)
4) A user_short.zip file (pretty large json file with every tweet and most relevant metadata)

The data was scraped using this method:
